# Foundation Checkpoint 02: E-Factory MVP Shell

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Completed

## Summary

Implemented the initial MVP shell for E-Factory (Admin Console), supporting multi-tenancy and factory profile management.

## Changes

- **Data Layer**:
  - Created `data/tenants/riyadhstone.json` (Tenant #1 Seed)
  - Created `data/factories/dhurma.example.json` (Factory Seed)
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Added `lib/efactory/storage.ts` for file-based JSON storage.
- **API**:
  - `GET/POST /api/efactory/tenants`
  - `GET/POST /api/efactory/factory-profile`
- **UI (Admin)**:
  - Dashboard: Tenant overview + Factory compliance status.
  - Factory Profile: Editable inputs for licenses and location.
  - Maintenance: Equipment list table + KPI placeholder.

## Integration Notes

- **Home Page**: Strictly untouched.
- **Routing**: All E-Factory routes are namespaced under `/efactory`.
- **Data**: All MVP data is offline-first (stored in `/data` JSON files).
