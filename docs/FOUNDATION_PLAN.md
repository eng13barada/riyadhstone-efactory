# FOUNDATION PLAN

## Overview
The Foundation Plan establishes the governance, structure, and asset management protocols necessary to support both the RiyadhStone Website and the E-Factory platform within the same repository.

## Steps
1.  **Governance & Naming**: Establish rules, naming conventions, and file structure. (Current Step)
2.  **Asset Registry**: Implement a centralized JSON registry for tracking all media assets.
3.  **Design System Extraction**: Document existing design tokens (Current State) to ensure consistency in future development.
4.  **Component Library**: (Future) Build atomic components based on the extracted design tokens.
5.  **Page Migration/Feature Build**: (Future) Systematically build or update pages following the new governance.

## Rules of Engagement
- **Allowed**: Creating documentation, adding new tools/scripts, creating new isolated components/pages.
- **Not Allowed**: Modifying the "Frozen" Home Page (`app/page.tsx`), global layout refactors that break existing pages.

## Resuming Work
- Check `task.md` for the current active task.
- Continue from the last completed step in this plan.
- Always review `PROJECT_GUARDRAILS.md` before starting a session.
