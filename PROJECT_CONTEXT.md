# PROJECT MASTER CONTEXT: RiyadhStone & E-Factory (GenAI Core)

**Version:** 3.0 (The Generative Shift)
**Identity:** "Engineered Stone = Trusted Results"
**Core Logic:** The system is an "Active AI Consultant", not a passive CMS.

## 1. The E-Factory Generative Engine

- **Philosophy:** "Chat-to-Build". The client talks to the AI; the AI builds the system.
- **Visual Generation:** The system uses AI (logic: Nano Banana Pro) to generate placeholders for products, backgrounds, and marketing copy based on the client's uploaded "Master PDF".
- **Interactive Assistant:** A persistent AI Chat interface helps the user troubleshoot, request features, or refine the design.

## 2. RiyadhStone Visual Identity (The 3 Styles)

1.  **Geometric Overlay:** Fine technical lines/grids overlaying real stone photos (Primary Style).
2.  **Raw Luxury:** High-res textures of natural stone.
3.  **The Sketch:** Hand-drawn technical sketches fading into real photos (for Engineering sections).
